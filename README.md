# StockAnalysis
Personal project completed 11/6/23 <br>

A script I wrote to analyze stock data. Skills improved from doing this project: Python data import, Jupyter interface/use, pandas use, and DateTime use

The code imports an account history (.CSV) of buys, sells, dividend activity, etc. It filters out everything except buys and sells. The code then groups the the buys/sells together from a specific stock (and can account for stock splits). The code then calculates the profit or loss for a if current position was sold. The code calculates if the position has been held for longer than 1 year for tax purposes. The script can account for stocks that have multiple buys/sells for portions of the position.
