# StockAnalysis
In progress 10/3/23

A script I wrote to analyze stock data. Skills improved from doing this project: Python data import, Jupyter interface/use, and pandas use

Code outline (some completed, some still in progress 10/3/23)
The code imports an account history (.CSV) of buys, sells, dividend activity, etc. It filters out everything except buys and sells. The code then groups the the buys/sells together from a specific stock (and can account for stock splits). The code then calculates the profit for a certain amount of a current position if it was sold. The code calculates which portion of that position has been held for longer than 1 year for tax purposes. The script can account for stocks that have multiple buys/sells for portions of the position.
